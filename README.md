#Scripts for making DEIMOS slitmasks
=====================
Written each steps as functions for easy swapping out codes

Warning: Not all functions work as well as I want them to
Please send feedback / bug reports.

plan_zwcl2341_slits.py is an example of how to use the functions

Future features
----------------
Make use of pyds9 to directly view fits and draw regions without outputting slit regions as .reg files
