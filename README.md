#Scripts for making DEIMOS slitmasks
=====================
obsplan_functions.py is a rewritten version of obsplan.py by Will Dawson.
Most steps have been rewritten as functions for swapping out steps easily

Notice that the names of the functions are planned to be as informative 
as possible to avoid using extra lines of comments. 

Warning: Not all functions work as well as I want them to
Please send feedback / bug reports.

plan_zwcl2341_slits.py is an example of how to use the functions


Future features
----------------
Make use of pyds9 to directly view fits and draw regions without outputting slit regions as .reg files
