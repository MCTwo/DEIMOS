v1_1_4 (July 10, 2003)

Notable changes:

- At least some longslit data now is successfully reduced by the
  pipeline.  No guarantees on reduction quality.  Things are probably
  good enough for standard stars, at least.

- New superdarks have been added for 2003 (FCS intensity has been
  greatly decreased).  We do not have any new ones for 900-line data -
  that is needed.  Update your CALIB_DATA files.

- After we implemented the slit-end corrections for v1_1, we figured
  that it'd be OK to exclude only the outermost 4 pixels on each slit,
  rather than the outermost 5.  However, the skylines are actually a
  bit sharper on that 5th pixel than along the rest of the slit; this
  caused the b-spline sky spectrum to be too sharp, especially on
  short slits, and accordingly the sky subtraction to yield
  'hollowed-out', 'donut' residuals (negative in the center of the
  line, positive on the outside).  Rerunning v1_1 reductions is
  probably advisable.

- Shifts between science data and flats are now determined robustly
  when the shifts are >~1.5 pix (via a cross-correlation to get an
  initial guess, followed by the existing centroid method); that was
  not true before.  Wavelength solutions in cases with large shifts
  could definitely be problematic, though..

- In cases where the arc-fitting yields poor results or few lines, we
  now fall back to the optical model + cross-correlation for
  wavelength solution and tilts.

- 'optimal' extractions in EXTRACT1D now uses FWHM=10 pixels if FWHM=0
  is passed to it.  This was a problem in a number of non-DEEP
  reductions, yielding optimal spectra that were 0 everywhere (boxcar
  was still OK).

- wavelength scales on the Allslit files are now correct (was a
  FLOATCOMPRESS issue).



v1_1_3 (May 19, 2003)

- cosmic-ray handling has been altered: CRs found in 2d are excluded
  when the data is coadded (rather than just using the temporal
  variation to find them in the coaddition process), and INFOMASK bit
  2^3 in spslit structures indicates where cosmic rays have been found
  (minor speedups result).  This should yield improvements in
  CR-rejection particularly for cases  with only 2 frames of data.

- We had been under the impression that the TOPDIST/BOTDIST bug (they
  are inverted from their original definition) in Drew Phillips's mask
  design software was fixed in mid-October, so the pipeline assumed no
  fix was needed for masks created after that date.  Instead, Drew
  opted to leave his code untouched; this means that the pipeline
  assumed objects were in the wrong position for recently-designed
  masks (flipped about the center of the slit), with bad consequences
  for object extraction, sky subtraction, etc.  Masks designed after
  mid-October and run through the pipeline will need to be rerun.

- "quicklook" data verification routines have been added.  For the
  moment, at least, they are DEEP- specific.  Missing species in arcs,
  FCS misalignment/buckling, alignment offsets in the spatial
  direction, bad or degrading seeing, and signal-to-noise are all
  evaluated, and audible & pop-up warnings are issued to the user if
  there are problems.  /QUICK keywords have been added to many of the
  pipeline routines; setting the keyword will cause the routines to
  act in less robust, but faster, ways.

- obslog routine added to generate log info on science files in DEEP2
  logsheet form.  typing 'obslog' at a command prompt in the desired
  directory  yields a log for all files; 'obslog n', where n is an
  integer, gives log info on the last n files.

------------------------------------------------------------------

v1_1_2 (April 14, 2003)

- Linelist has been tested for a variety of 600-line scenarios, and
  tweaked accordingly.

- Previously, CR's on arcs could cause the arc tilt as a function of
  wavelength to have bad fits.  Two changes to deimos_arcfit have been
  added to prevent this; hopefully, we will no longer suffer from bad tilts!

- a color table issue with qa_check has been fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
v1_1_1 (April 11, 2003)

- A number of minor bug fixes have occurred; notably, SLITPA and
  MASKPA in v1_1 file headers were incorrect.

- Zn has been added to the non-DEEP linelist (lamp_NIST_blue.dat).  A
  few lines might be helpful in the extreme blue, though ~10-20s
  exposures might be desirable for picking them up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

v1_1 (April 1, 2003)


Major changes:


- Drew Phillip's optical model is now used for initial wavelength
  guesses.  Large tweaks are sometimes still required (e.g. due to
  differences in FCS setup from the model), but nevertheless this has
  proved to be quite successful.

- Arc handling has been totally revamped, allowing good solutions for
  600-line data; among other changes, a new lamp list,
  lamp_NIST_blue.dat, should work better than the default
  lamp_NIST.dat for low-resolution/non-DEEP2 data.  We can now deal
  with multiple arcs (including combining partially saturated with
  unsaturated arcs; see COMBINE_ARCS), and can use separate arcs for
  red side vs. blue.

- Slits overlapping edges of chips are now reduced, not ignored.  This
  could add as many as 8 objects/mask (~2-6 should be typical).
  Regions with no data have inverse variance 0 and the 2^2 bit of MASK
  set to 1.

- The derivative tails at the spatial ends of slits (due to something
  like sub-pixel shifts between the slitfunction derived from flats
  and the science data, though that cannot be the actual cause) are
  now corrected when possible, giving us ~2 more rows per slit for sky.

- Non-local sky subtraction has been greatly improved, and is now used
  throughout the pipeline (including extractions & spec1d, with
  non-local results in separate HDUs).

- B-spline breakpoint handling and sky region determination has
  changed, yielding much better (though still noisy) results for short slits.

- Extractions totally revamped.  Standard extractions are no longer a
  boxcar with interpolation and a non-inverse variance weighted
  optimal extraction, but instead a boxcar with bad pixels compensated
  for based on the fraction of light from the object missing (using
  the object's profile) and an optimal extraction with inverse
  variance weighting.  A major bug (which caused the
  optimal-extraction kernel to be the same for all objects) has been fixed.

- Sky spectra are now stored in the spec1d structures, and the inverse
  variance in the extracted spectra due to covariant sky subtraction
  is properly included.

- Positions of serendipitous sources on the sky (RA/dec) are now
  determined relative to object position using slit PA.  Serendips now
  have naming convention 'sXXXXXXX[b/c/d/...]' where XXXXXXXX is the label of
  a source on the same slit, and [b/c/d/...] is a letter, b for the
  first serendip on a slit, c for the second, etc.

- Flat-fielding, and particularly slit function determination, has
  been made much more robust; spectral ends of chips are also much 
  better than before. Additionally, we have greatly improved the behavior of
  the b-spline at the spectral ends of the array.

- To deal with the time variations in the FCS scattered light, the pipeline
  now chooses amongst multiple superdarks rather than always using an
  August one.

- Bad pixel mask has been greatly improved (using superdark data).

- Old QA routines have been updated and replaced with QA_CHECK .


More minor changes and fixes:


- More keywords saved in FITS headers (including Gaussian sigma of
  skylines and PAs for rotation curve analysis).

- The SKYIND tag in spslit files has been removed to prevent
  occasional problems combining spslit structures.

- spec1d structures have been changed (e.g. to include the sky
  spectra); see documentation.  Extraction width definitions have been
  unified between boxcar and optimal; the IVARFUDGE parameter is an
  estimate of how much one might want to multiply the stated IVAR by
  to match the actual fluctuations in the extracted spectrum (this was
  added mostly as a diagnostic; it varies significantly from one only
  for sky slitlets [due to using the same rows for the sky bspline and
  extraction], bright objects [which violate the assumptions made],
  and short slits with concomitantly noisy sky subtraction (for which
  IVARFUDGE reflects the reality).

- Arc lines are now identified as blends based on what lines are
  actually in a mask's arcs, not based on the complete linelist.

- New .plan file keywords: REDARC, BLUEARC, and LINELIST .

- SPEC1D_ASCII routine to convert spec1d output to ASCII files.

- FLAG_CR now finds CR's iteratively (only used for bsplines)


To be done:

- When we have few identified arc lines, if we fit, say, 2 terms in
  the wavelength solution, fix the 3rd-6th from the optical model and
  fit the first two, rather than only including 2 terms in the
  solution total.

- Develop the ability to combine results from different arc frames,
  rather than combining all frames and then fitting.

- Handle the varying resolution along a slit that comes from big
  notches in the slit function.  The interim fix might be to only use
  sky rows with the same slitfn value as the object; longer-term, we
  might convolve all rows to matching resolution.

- Incorporate atmospheric dispersion and wavelength-dependent seeing
  into the extractions.  This will probably require a rewrite &
  generalization of extract1d.

- Flux calibration.

- Re-implement quicklook.

- Frame-by-frame QA diagnostics.

- Time-varying pixflat files, not just superdarks

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes from v1_0 -> v1_0_2 (November 2002):

- Much better handling of vignetting added

- flat fields, esp. 2d slit functions and fringe amplitude, improved.

- minor arcfitting improvements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1_0 (Nov. 7, 2002)

Changes:

- nonlocal sky is now implemented in the pipeline! (more tuning is
  still required, though.)  For slits with <12 rows suitable for
  measuring the sky spectrum, a 2d, nonlocal-sky-subtracted spectrum 
  can be found in HDU 3 of the slit.XXXX file (no differences in
  calibslit or spSlit files).  
- Extracted 1d spectra based on the nonlocal version of the slit will 
  then be found in HDUs 5-8 of the spec1d.XXXX file.  
- Allslit files (nonzero only for those slits where nonlocal sky was
  performed, to facilitate compression) are also created, named
  Allslits[0 or 1].XXXX.nonlocal.fits.gz

- an array named INFOMASK has been added (at the end) to the spSlit
  and slit BINTABLEs.  This array is like MASK, but indicates
  non-catastrophic problems.  The 2^0th bit is set for all >0% vignetted
  pixels, and the 2^1 bit for pixels identified as cosmic rays in 2d
  (with no reference to other frames).

- The bar between slitlets in Allslit files has been enlarged, and now
  is set to -1000 - slitnum, where slitnum is the slitnumber of the
  slit _below_ the bar.

- serendip detection is greatly improved - more robust to outlying
  pixels and background gradients, reducing the number of bogus
  serendips greatly.

- extractions have been tested with fake 2d spectra inserted on sky
  slits and extraction widths optimized (1.1*FWHM for boxcar, 
  +/- 1.75*sigma [1.5*FWHM] for optimal; optimal had definitively better S/N

- QA plots (quality_plots.ps in the /ps subdirectory of each mask)
  have been improved.  A robust estimate of the S/N per pixel in an
  extracted spectrum for an R=23.5 object is obtained for each mask,
  allowing mask-to-mask comparisons.

- all (>0%) vignetted pixels on the red side are now masked
- scattered light is now removed before the vignetting flat is
  created.  This yielded only minor improvements.
- improved vignetting mask in deimos_badchip.
- improved determination of DLAM when arc lines cross the vignetting 
transition


Problems:
- insufficient number of sky rows going into the bsplines on short
  slits, causing artifacts - need nonlocal sky to be optimized.
- slit edge fix not incorporated into the pipeline yet, though we
  think we know how
- wavelength solutions still have problems at sub-pixel level on
  alignment stars
- need to look at 4249 Allslit file again when regenerated --
  looks like a bad column was not fully masked?
- should make inverse-variance weighted extractions an option
- need to check if slit number bars in Allslit files are always right
- serendip identification needs more tuning, need to implement
  matching to PCAT catalogs
- more tests of extractions and QA assessments

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0_10 (Oct. 26, 2002)

Changes:

- major changes to slit-edge-finding to improve robustness
- substantial improvements to flatfield code, including switch to a 2d
  slit function correction to match our rectification method and much
  better handling of vignetted regions
- overhaul of arc-line lists and fit techniques; addition of extra
 arc line QA info to help us make the next improvements
- definition of vignetting flat to apply to science data, and
 implementation of this correction.  Currently 60% correction is applied in
 the blue, 100% in the red; refinement may be possible, but these look
 OK for now
- we now cut at 50% vignetting everywhere, rather than the prior,
 artificial cuts.  We will likely make that
 more conservative soon, esp. on the red side.
- we no longer correct for crosstalk on chip 5 on dates after the
 crosstalk disappeared
- we discovered that the science file FITS tables were giving
 incorrect TOPDIST/BOTDIST on masks processed by Drew after July 24;
 this caused object positions used to define sky subtraction and for
 some object extractions to be way off.  The pipeline now
 transparently fixes these tables.
- moved to flux-conserving, rather than inverse-variance weighted,
 extractions (both boxcar/tophat and optimal)
- we now try to extract serendips, though most are probably false
 positives right now.
- improvements to Allslit file generation (wavelength ranges, object
 numbers on both ends of the slits)
- lots of bug fixes, additions to QA measurements, etc.

Note that this list does _not_ cover the spec1d (redshift) code, which
has progressed greatly in the last month.

Problems:
- insufficient number of sky rows going into the bsplines on short
      slits, causing artifacts - need nonlocal sky.
- wavelength solutions still have problems at sub-pixel level on
      alignment stars
- non-local sky not integrated into pipeline, pending bug fixes.
      code has been checked into CVS.
- slit edge fix not incorporated into the pipeline yet, though we
      think we know how
- need to look at 4249 Allslit file again - looks like a bad column
      was not fully masked.
- should make inverse-variance weighted extractions an option
- need improved serendip handling


v0_9 (Sep. 27, 2002)

Changes: 

- both boxcar and optimal 1d extractions are automatically performed
    by domask; spec1d files created
- emission line redshift determination has been implemented and
    often works; linewidth determination also implemented 
    for emission objects
- quicklook has been implemented, though improvement is desirable
- pipeline routines have been made more flexible; both POLYFLAG and TRACESET
    coexist in the same procedures.  The type of lambda array and
    which chips to reduce can now be controlled via the plan file.
- _All_ MASK arrays are now of type byte.  BITMASK and MASK in slit
     files have been replaced by MASK and CRMASK, respectively
- flatfielding has been greatly improved/made more robust.  We no
    longer attempt to flatfield or slitfunction-correct alignment stars.
- pixel-to-pixel response flat has been greatly improved.  The
    routines now look for 'processed_pix_mult_flat.fits.gz' in
    $CALIB_DATA .  Download it, it's now ready for prime time!
- as a consequence of the improved pixflat, we have been able to
    identify more bad pixels and vignetted regions, leading to
    modifications in the bad pixel mask.
- corrections for the glow at chip edges and scattered light in flats
    have been added to the pipeline
- deimos_skytweak has been made more robust; it now rejects CRs and
    vignetted regions, and only uses good pixels in determining the
    median shift.
- frames are now corrected to electrons per hour exposure time before
    combining (in DEIMOS_SPSLIT)
- better use of vignetting bit in badmask, e.g. now include it in the
     bitmask in DEIMOS_SPSLIT
- bintab index file (obj_info.MASKNUMBER.fits.gz) now created
- extreme CRs are excluded from the bspline sky spectrum
- A 'superdark' which exhibits the FCS excess light pattern has been
     created; it, along with a potential constant offset, is now removed
     from the data in DEIMOS_SPSLIT
- various disabled and commented out code of ancient origin has been
     removed from pipeline routines
- along with the usual bugfixes and minor changes (e.g. the
     edgefinding for negative-PA masks)


Problems:
- insufficient number of sky rows going into the bsplines on short
      slits, causing artifacts
- wavelength solutions still have problems (600 AA off on some
      alignment stars!, .1-.2 AA issues on ordinary objects)
- non-local sky not integrated into pipeline, pending improved
      wavelength solutions.  DEIMOS_SKYTWEAK_VAR has been checked in but
      not added to the pipeline.
- slit edge fix not incorporated into the pipeline yet, though we
      think we know how



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0_8 (July 22, 2002)

- fink_merge handles sky slits
- lambda_eval recognizes tracesets
- more badmask improvements
- flatfield bugs fixed, now uses djs_median (handles edges better)
- use tracesets to fit and encode wavelength solutions
- record wavelength fit residuals for each line/slit
- avsigclip now rejects upper and lower outliers
- deimos_badchip can distinguish chip defects (1) from vignetted areas (2)
- many routines changed to new deimos_badchip convention
- 5th order polynomial required for good wavelength fit
- previous line list hopelessly inaccurate.  0.05A problems all over. 
   now residual is typically < .01 A on blue side ~ .02 A on red side
- serious bspline bug fixed (users must update idlutils!)
- do sky fit on coadded image (so we only do bspline_iterfit once)
- hot pixel near serial on chip 5 makes a mess - cleaned up
- djs_maskinterp implemented in arcs and sort of for science spectra
- bitmasks rearranged - bit 2 means "can interpolate over"
- gauss fit (gfit_line) stuff
- tweak wavelength solution to sky lines before final sky subtraction

Problems:
- wavelength solutions still not always good enough
- still no non-local sky subtraction (B. Gerke working on it)
- extraction to 1-D spectrum not integrated in pipeline
- skytweak seems to have broken the star alignment boxes

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0_7 (July 14, 2002)

- sky determined away from object (where possible)
- flatfield code totally rewritten.  This fixes saturated alignment
  box flats and numerous other problems. 
- saturation mask generated in deimos_read_chip
- masks propagate better to slit* files
- deimos_arcfit uses everyn again
- dlam is correct now (confused indices in deimos_arcfit)
- sky tweak (dlamsky) computed in slitexam but not implemented
- fixes in fink_merge and deimos_skytweak
- limit range of lambda evaluation in slitexam
- if more than 3 flats, use last 3. 

Problems:
- still have funny business at (spectral) end of each spectrum
- still no sky tweak implemented, will look at outputs from deimos_skytweak
- badmask looks like it is still missing a lot of bad CTE columns
- mask alignment appears to be fixed in spSlit files, but wrong in
     slit* files (?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0_6 (July 13, 2002)

Many changes, resulting from July Keck run

- flatfielding now fixed up (more or less) using modified Marinoni
  code (splitting pixmask/fringing/slitfn)
- alignment boxes get a top-hat smooth now for better centroiding
- better warnings for missing data
- first attempts at 1-d extraction
- fink_merge and other merging routines
- dlog improvements
- restricted polynomial wavelength solution, evaluated with
  lambda_eval, modified with dlam.  This stuff nearly works, 
   failing on long slits. 
- still no tweaking of wavelength solution to skylines
- still using all rows to determine sky (instead of masking out
  object)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0_5 ?  Somebody forgot to add releasnotes...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0_4 (June 13, 2002)

- No longer use gzip -8; use compress on badchip file
- Mask information is updated; is now propagated correctly through
   spSlit files
- Use slit width in deimos arcfit (so alignment boxes work)
- plot / noplot keywords work?
- domask script runs everything; domask shell script calls it. 
- clean-up of deimos_spslit
- still applying flats to wrong place
- hotpixel mask still needed
- spslit_combine combines data from multiple exposures, but
    doesn't refit wavelength to sky or handle anything else by CRs
    yet.
- still no 1-d extraction
- still use everything for sky fit - don't know where objects are!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0_3 (June 5, 2002)

- Slit names are correct
- Plan file format changed (rawdatadir, outdatadir)
- Slit edge finding still hacked up. 
- Strongly tilted slits are fine. 
- Changed to polynomial wavelength solution for arcs; will do sky
    lines with spline?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0_2 (June 4, 2002)

We now get through the wavelength solution to writing spSlit files. 
- Wavelength fits are good in general, strongly tilted slits need some 
   help. 
- Slit names not read correctly from bintables yet
- Slit edge finding is a bit hacked up (may revert to 0_1). 
- Badmask file is now generated if not present

Tomorrow we will split out the spCalib stuff properly

Other than that, we are doing well. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0_1 (June 3, 2002)  Finkbeiner & Davis

First tag - running with idlutils v4_9_11 (today's CVS version of it)
Top level routine is deimos_2dreduce.  Still lots of things
hardwired.  Still has Drew's -1 bug in it. 

Logic goes roughly:

deimos_2dreduce (read all the files)
  deimos_spslit
    deimos_traceall
    deimos_fitwavelength
    write spslit files
