; PURPOSE
; 	A routine to convert spec1d FITS files into ascii tables
; 	containing the flux, ivar, and lambda values in a 1-d
; 	spectrum. 
;
;%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
; SYNTAX
;	spec1d_ascii, files=files, /horne, /optimal, /boxcar, $
;                     /boxsprof, /nlsky
;	             
;%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
; INPUTS
;       files = a list of spec1d FITS file names (type = STRING).
;%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
; KEYWORDS
;       /horne, 
;       /optimal, 
;       /boxcar, 
;       /boxsprof = select the corresponding extraction from the
;                   spec1d FITS files and print to ascii files. If
;                   more than one of these keywords is set, then only
;                   one will be recognized. 
;       /nlsky = select the non-local sky-subtracted extraction if
;                available. 
;
;%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
; OUTPUTS
;       ascii files written to the current directory with the file
;       name spec1d.xxxx.nnn.ooooooo.dat where xxxx is the mask name,
;       nnn is the slit number and ooooooo is the object name. The
;       ascii data is put in columns with a single initial line to
;       label the columns: lambda, flux, ivar (in that order).
