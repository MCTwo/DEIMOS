; NAME
;     make_bintab_file.pro
;
; PURPOSE
;     Reads the bin tables from a raw DEIMOS frame and writes the
;     tables to a new .fits file. It also reads-in the pcat .fits file
;     corresponding to the given mask and stores the pcat structure as
;     the last extension in the new .fits file.
;
;
; SYNTAX
;     make_bintab_file, planfile
;
; INPUTS
;     planfile = the name of a file which is assumed to be in current
;                directory unless the full path is specified.
;
; KEYWORDS
;     None.
;
; OUTPUTS
;     A file named "xxxx.bintabs.fits" where xxxx denotes the mask
;     number (e.g. 2101 or 1145). This file contains (as .fits
;     extensions) the bin tables that were read from the raw DEIMOS
;     frame. It also contains the pcat data structure. The file is
;     written to the current directory (for the DEEP spec2d reductions
;     this directory should be the same directory as that which will
;     contain the reduced 2d slit files. 
;
; PROCEDURES CALLED

; EXAMPLES
;
;
; COMMENTS
;     This routine is part of the spec2d package. It is intended to be
;     called by the routine domask.pro. Note that this routine assumes
;     that the raw DEIMOS frame pointed to by the planfile is UNcompressed. 
;
; HISTORY
;     Created July 18, 2002 by mcc.
;     Revised July 25, 2002 by mcc - added to routine so that the
;        corresponding pcat structure is also read-in and stored in
;        the bintabs file. 
;     Revised August 12, 2002 by mcc - revised so that entire pcat
;        file is not saved in the xxxx.bintabs.fits file. Instead only
;        the needed subset of the photometry catalog is included.
;     Revised August 26, 2002 by mcc - revised routine so that a
;        portion of the 1HS mask file (1HS.xxxx.fits) is saved to the
;        bin table file (xxxx.bintabs.fits). In particular, the
;        ObjectList bin table from the mask file is saved so as to
;        provide information regarding the position of multiple
;        objects in a single slit --- This information is employed
;        in the do_extract routine (in the 1-d extraction portion of
;        the pipeline.  
;     Revised October 21, 2002 by mcc - correct for bug in mask design
;        (switching of topdist and botdist tags in slitobjmap bin
;        table).
;     Revised December 10, 2002 by mcc - removed keyword
;     /nophot. Routine is now smart enough to check if the mask is a
;     DEEP2 1HS mask before attempting to locate pcat information.
